Lchown - perl interface to the lchown(2) system call

The Lchown module provides a perl interface to the lchown(2) UNIX system
call, on systems that support lchown.  The lchown(2) call is used to
change the ownership and group of symbolic links.

DEPENDENCIES

   The test suite requires the Test::More module, available from CPAN.

   The oldest perl version that I've tested against is 5.00404.

INSTALLATION

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

This module should build and pass tests on systems without the lchown
system call.  Any lchown call will fail at runtime on such systems.

Since the lchown system call often requires root privileges to make any
change, most of the tests will be skipped unless "make test" is run as
root.
